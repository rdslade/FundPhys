                <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field">The whole story</a><h2>
                    <p class="tws"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Magnete">De Magnete</a> stood for the 200 years as the most important treatise on the subject of magnetism. Before Gilbert, no one had used the terms "magnetic pole", "electric force", and "electric attraciton"; and he was also the first to clearly distinguish between magnetic and electrical forces. The word "electricity" was coined by Gilbert, who based it on the Greek word for amber.
                    
                    To prove his hypothesis regarding the magnetism of the planet, Gilbert conducted years of experiments, and that was the first example of someone using what we now refer to as the experimental scientific method. The revolutionary new concept of using experimentation to support one's hypothesis radically changed the course of science, ushering in an entirely new age of scientific theory, exploration, and discovery.
